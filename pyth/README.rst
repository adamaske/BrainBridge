Mark *italic text* with one asterisk, **bold text** with two.
For ``monospaced text``, use two "backquotes" instead.

A normal paragraph ending with ``::`` will flow and be word-wrapped::

    If the next paragraph is indented by four or more spaces, it will be monospaced text, without flow (or even wrapping in some non-print cases.)

    You can have multiple paragraphs like this, as long as they
    are all indented by the same amount.

If the next paragraph is indented by four or more spaces, it will be monospaced text, without flow (or even wrapping in some non-print cases.)

You can have multiple paragraphs like this, as long as they
are all indented by the same amount.

> A block quotation will wrap and flow, and can have *inline*
``markup`` just like a regular paragraph.  It will be indented on
the left (and possibly the right) margins, and may have a vertical
quotation line on the left.

 >> With two spaces and two right angle brackets, a following block
 quotation will be doubly indented, and will have a second vertical
 quotation line along the left if quotation lines are generated.

  > >> A third level of quotation is the maximum level possible.
